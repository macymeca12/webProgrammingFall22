        <p>There‚Äôs quotes like ‚Äú a record. If it is to be useful to science must be continuously extended it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. ‚Äú  and ‚Äú the only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would result from its use.‚Äú that just being up this question in mind as I was reading, that sure the idea being able to store information that can be build is most necessary. But I can‚Äôt help to think in today‚Äôs perspective where every little thing is either stored or saved even though we might not be able to retain it. Since there is such an abundance of information now. Which the author does make a point that storing it isn‚Äôt enough but being able to consult it is important and that not everyone does consult it. This reading feels very relevant to present there was something that caught my eye where he said there will always be plenty of things to compute of the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things because even though he refers taking data with keyboard punches it‚Äôs very much like today but with social media.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs weird to think that the internet is now about 30 years old and it‚Äôs true it is something we take for granted and expect it to ‚Äúbe there‚Äù especially today since a lot has changed from when the article came out in 2010. We are much more online that we ever were. I do agree to an extent with the principle of universality. The internet should be accesible to all and no government should be hindering anyone‚Äôs usage but the idea of allowing an site to link to any site is the part I become unsure of. Just because since the internet is such a vast place it leaves younger audiences susceptible to things that they may not be mentally developed for. While I do agree companies should not be privatizing the internet and creating these small restricted worlds and people should be able to make their websites without companies permissions. The user should also being able to link stuff online without their information being collected by such companies. Going back to the web core principles the idea of free bandwidth is such a great thing just because we run on technology at this point our health, education, and the economy relies on it for advancements. Controlling and restricting bandwidth through privatization removes the accessibility of the web. I guess reading it from the perspective of a decade year later it does make wonder would the author opinion of social machine would change just because of the bubbles it creates on the internet. By bubbles I mean our own social bubbles so the information we access is connected to our beliefs and because of that there has been push backs I feel with certain advancements through democracy and science, especially because of the spread of misinformation and disinformation. </p>
